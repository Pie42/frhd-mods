# frhd-mods
A place to collect + display the mods I've made for freerider hd.

The purpose of this repository is to have all of my mods in one place, let me put out changes (and have them be propogated automatically), and make it easier to find all of my mods.

To-do:

Add descriptions of the different mods.
